## Project Description
----------------------
The Task was to analyze advertising campaigns to optimize marketing ROI across Facebook and Google AdWords. The primary challenge was to determine which platform was more effective for conversions and how to allocate budgets optimally.


Our objectives were to analyze conversion data, compare platform effectiveness, predict future conversions, and determine the most cost-effective campaign timings.


The following steps were undertaken to address the project's needs:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered conversion data from both Facebook and Google AdWords.
2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Performed a two-sample t-test to compare mean conversions.
   - Conducted regression analysis to predict conversions from Facebook clicks.
3. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Analyzed conversion trends on a monthly and weekly basis.
   - Evaluated the impact of different campaign timings.
4. **Cointegration Test:** Examined the long-term equilibrium between advertising spend and conversions.
5. **Data Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to visualize trends related to conversions, click-through rates, and advertising costs.


The analysis provided key insights, showing that Facebook generally yielded higher conversion rates than Google AdWords. We also developed predictive models and identified the best times for running ad campaigns. The project's findings were instrumental in refining budget allocation strategies and improving the overall effectiveness of the marketing efforts.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis not only enhanced our understanding of advertising dynamics on major platforms but also supported strategic decision-making for future campaign management. The project stands as a testament to the power of data-driven marketing strategies.
